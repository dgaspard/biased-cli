# PROTECTED TEST DOCUMENTATION

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Test File Protection Policy

This directory contains unit tests that are **PROTECTED** and should **NOT** be modified without explicit user authorization.

### For AI Agents Reading This:

**DO NOT:**
- Modify test assertions or expected behaviors
- Delete or refactor existing tests
- "Improve" or "optimize" tests without being asked
- Change test structure or file organization
- Remove or alter protection warnings

**DO:**
- Add NEW tests in SEPARATE files for new features
- Report test failures clearly to the user
- Suggest fixes but wait for approval
- Respect the protection markers in test files

### Test Files:
- `cli.test.ts` - Protected unit tests for core CLI commands

### Running Tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### User Authorization Required:
Any modifications to protected test files require explicit user instruction. When in doubt, ask the user before making changes.

# Knowledge Base (AI-Optimized)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **FOR AI AGENTS**: This is your PRIMARY source for business context and domain knowledge. Read files from this directory, NOT from `biased/docs/`.

## What is This?

This directory contains AI-optimized versions of all business documentation from `biased/docs/`. It is automatically generated by running:

```bash
biased updateKnowledge
```

## Why Use This Instead of `docs/`?

1. **All formats converted to Markdown** - Office documents (.docx, .pdf, .xlsx, .pptx) are converted to markdown for better AI parsing
2. **Metadata included** - Each file has frontmatter with source file info and last updated timestamp
3. **Consistent structure** - All files follow the same format regardless of original file type
4. **Binary file metadata** - Images and other binary files have metadata placeholders explaining what they are

## File Structure

This directory mirrors the structure of `biased/docs/` but with all files in markdown format:

- `branding/` - Brand identity, style guides, logos, colors, typography
- `business-process/` - Process maps, workflows, SOPs
- `strategy/` - Strategic plans, roadmaps, OKRs
- `onboarding/` - Employee onboarding guides
- `operations/` - Operational procedures, runbooks
- `training/` - Training materials, tutorials
- `summary.md` - Auto-generated summary of all knowledge base files

## For AI Agents

When you need to understand:
- **Brand guidelines** → Read `branding/` files
- **Business processes** → Read `business-process/` files  
- **Strategic direction** → Read `strategy/` files
- **Operational procedures** → Read `operations/` files
- **Domain terminology** → Read `glossary.md` (if exists)

## Updating the Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is automatically updated during `biased init`. To manually update:

```bash
biased updateKnowledge
```

This will:
- Convert new/modified files from `docs/` to markdown
- Update existing files if source has changed
- Remove files that no longer exist in `docs/`
- Generate a new `summary.md`

## Do Not Edit Directly

⚠️ **Do not edit files in this directory directly**. They are auto-generated and will be overwritten. Instead:
1. Edit source files in `biased/docs/`
2. Run `biased updateKnowledge` to regenerate this directory
